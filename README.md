This app helps people discover and rate tennis courts. The app is built with a React front end, Express server backend with a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container using AWS, as well as JWT token authentication. The styling is done with Material UI. For state, we primarily use React hooks.

We can execute the same commands we would execute in our local psql shell on our Docker container.
